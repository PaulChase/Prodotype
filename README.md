# Prodotype

### A product rating and review website witten in vanilla js.

This was my first fully developed and deployed static website.

It was written in

* HTML
* W3 CSS
* Pure CSS
* Vanilla JS

Every part of the webiste is completly static, but you can add reviews and see it appear immediatly on the website and will be lost after a pagre reload.
